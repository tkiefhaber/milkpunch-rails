My wife was always having trouble keeping track of with which side she had fed our newborn and when,
so I made an app for her to keep track.

It's free to sign up and has options for left, right, bottle and meds (if your baby is on them).

It also has a page that picks up RSS feeds from several topics to keep the user entertained while feeding.

Needs help stylistically.
